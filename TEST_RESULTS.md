## 🎯 Clinical Significance

### What This Means:

**Patient Status:**
- ✅ Definite tremor present
- ✅ Frequencies match Parkinson's disease pattern (5.5-5.75 Hz)
- ✅ Consistent across both recordings
- ✅ Severity: Classified as SEVERE

**Tremor Type:**
- **Primary:** Rest tremor (Parkinsonian type)
- **Secondary:** Some essential/postural component (especially File 1)
- **Consistency:** Y-axis (forward-backward) dominance

**Diagnostic Value:**
- Strong evidence of rest tremor at Parkinsonian frequencies
- Consistent between recordings → reliable measurement
- Severity suggests clinically significant tremor
- Would warrant clinical follow-up

### Recommendations:

1. **Clinical Correlation:**
   - Patient should be evaluated for Parkinson's disease
   - Rest tremor at 5-6 Hz is highly suggestive
   - Severe amplitude warrants attention

2. **Further Testing:**
   - Compare with/without motor (eliminate vibration artifact)
   - Test during voluntary movement (should reduce)
   - Test with medication if PD suspected

3. **Data Quality:**
   - Excellent signal quality
   - Clear frequency peaks
   - Stable measurements across recordings
   - Suitable for clinical decision-making

## 📊 Visualization Recommendations

When viewing in GUI (`offline_analyzer.py`):

**New Layout (v3.1):**
1. **Row 1 (Filter + Metrics):** Bode plots + Clinical metrics table
2. **Row 2 (Dominant Axis):** Y-axis (gray) raw, filtered, and overlay with time/units labels
3. **Row 3 (Resultant Vector):** Magnitude raw, filtered, and overlay with time/units labels
4. **Row 4 (PSD Analysis):** Y-axis PSD, resultant vector PSD, band power bars (m²/s⁴)

**Look for:**
- **Row 1:** Filter response verification + tremor classification display
- **Row 2:** Y-axis (dominant) showing strong 5-6 Hz oscillations with envelope
- **Row 3:** Resultant vector showing overall tremor magnitude
- **Row 4:** Clear peaks at 5.5-5.75 Hz in PSD, rest band (red) > essential band (blue)

**Key Observations:**
- Dominant axis automatically identified as Y (gray color, anterior-posterior)
- All time-domain plots include Time (s) and units (m/s²) on axes
- Envelope plots show tremor intensity modulation
- Resultant PSD shows overall magnitude frequency content
- Bar chart shows power with proper units (m²/s⁴)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Testing:
```bash
# Run GUI analyzer (v3.1)
python3 offline_analyzer.py
# Click "Load CSV Data"
# Select either CSV file
# View 4×3 dashboard:
#   - Row 1: Filter design + metrics
#   - Row 2: Dominant axis (Y) analysis
#   - Row 3: Resultant vector analysis
#   - Row 4: PSD comparison
```

### For Data Collection:
1. Record more sessions to establish baseline
2. Consider recording without motor (validate no artifact)
3. Record during different tasks:
   - Pure rest (no motor)
   - Holding motor (current)
   - During movement (kinetic tremor test)

### For Analysis:
1. Compare tremor amplitude over multiple sessions
2. Track dominant frequency stability
3. Monitor Y-axis tremor progression
4. Assess medication effects (if applicable)
